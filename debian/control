Description: libp2p implementation in Go
 libp2p is a networking stack and library modularized out of The IPFS
 Project, and bundled separately for other tools to use. 
 .
 libp2p is the product of a long, and arduous quest of understanding -- a
 deep dive into the internet's network stack, and plentiful peer-to-peer
 protocols from the past. Building large scale peer-to-peer systems has been
 complex and difficult in the last 15 years, and libp2p is a way to fix that.
 It is a "network stack" -- a protocol suite -- that cleanly separates
 concerns, and enables sophisticated applications to only use the protocols
 they absolutely need, without giving up interoperability and upgradeability.
 libp2p grew out of IPFS, but it is built so that lots of people can use it,
 for lots of different projects.
